It hard to generalize usage with names, but it seems like if something is big enough to be unique like oceans, the Sun, seas, skyscrapers or exceptional like the Mona Lisa then "the" is used. And otherwise, absence of an article follows.

If something has concrete name like hotels, theaters, museums or skyscrapers, then "the" is used (consider vs hospitals, stadiums).

If something can be represented as a group, then "the" is used with the group and no article is used with a single object, like a group of lakes or a group of mountains.

If something is usually not so big enough, notwithstanding exceptional examples, then no article is used, like with waterfalls (notwithstanding Niagra Falls), parks (notwithstanding Central park).

Questionable:
- Swamps (using the)
- Institutes (using the) vs Universities and Colleges (without an article)
- Canyons (without an article)
- Stadiums (without an article)

Exceptions:
- [ ] Tower bridge
- [ ] The High street
- [ ] The Matterhorn mountain
- [ ] The Grand canyon
- [ ] Pattern "the ... of ..."
  - [ ] The University of Colorado
  - [ ] The Temple of Ranakpur
  - [ ] The Cathedral of Siena

Note:
- Archipelagos (which is a group of islands — use with "the")
